## Troubleshooting

- **Issue: Server not responding**
  - **Solution**: Check your network connection and ensure the backend server is running. Verify that environment variables are correctly set.

- **Issue: Build fails with dependency errors**
  - **Solution**: Delete `node_modules` folder, clear cache with `npm cache clean --force` or `yarn cache clean`, reinstall dependencies with `npm install` or `yarn install`.

- **Issue: Styling not applied correctly**
  - **Solution**: Verify Tailwind CSS classes are correctly applied in your components. Check the build process and ensure Tailwind CSS is configured properly.

- **Issue: Redux state not updating**
  - **Solution**: Double-check action creators and reducers in Redux slices. Ensure that state updates are dispatched correctly and reducers are returning new state objects.

- **Issue: CORS Error**
  - **Description**: CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) errors occur when frontend and backend servers are hosted on different domains and the backend does not allow requests from the frontend domain.
  - **Solution**: 
    - Configure the backend server (Django) to allow CORS requests from the frontend domain. This can be done by installing the Django CORS package (`django-cors-headers`) and configuring it to whitelist the frontend domain in your Django settings.
    - Example configuration in Django:
      ```python
      # settings.py
      CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS = [
          "http://localhost:3000",  # Replace with your frontend URL
          "https://your-production-domain.com",
      ]
      ```
    - Ensure that the CORS middleware is properly installed and activated in your Django application.
