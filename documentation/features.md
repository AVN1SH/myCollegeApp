## Key Features and Components

### Dashboard

- **Overview**: The dashboard serves as a centralized hub for users, providing a summary view of critical information. It typically includes widgets and components such as attendance summaries, upcoming events, course progress, and notifications.
- **Functionality**: Users can quickly access essential data and perform actions relevant to their roles (student, faculty, etc.). For example, students might see their class schedule and assignments, while faculty members might have tools for grading and managing classes.

### Authentication

- **Login Functionality**: Users authenticate using their email and password. Upon successful login, a session token is generated and stored locally (in localStorage or sessionStorage) to maintain user authentication across sessions.
- **Signup Process**: New users register by providing necessary details such as name, email, mobile number, and password. Validation ensures data integrity and security.

### Admissions

- **Admission Form Details**: The admission form collects essential information from applicants, such as personal details, contact information, educational qualifications, and supporting documents.
- **Validation**: Zod schemas are used for form validation, ensuring that data entered meets specified criteria (e.g., minimum character length, valid email format, required fields).
- **Processing**: Upon submission, the data is processed server-side, stored in a database, and used for admission decisions or further processing.

### Course Management

- **Display of Courses**: Courses are presented to users with relevant details such as course name, description, faculty, schedule, and enrollment status.
- **Management Features**: Administrative users can add new courses, update existing ones, and delete courses as necessary. These actions are typically performed through an admin dashboard or backend API.
- **Integration**: Courses data is integrated with backend services (e.g., Django REST API) to fetch, update, and delete course information.

### Student Profiles

- **Profile Features**: Each student has a profile displaying personal information, educational history, progress metrics (e.g., grades, attendance), and possibly extracurricular activities.
- **Data Storage**: Student profiles are stored securely in the database, with sensitive information encrypted and access controlled based on user roles.

### Faculty Profiles

- **Profile Display**: Faculty profiles showcase details such as name, contact information, subjects taught, and academic credentials.
- **Management**: Faculty members might have privileges to update their profiles, manage course materials, and provide feedback on student performance.
- **Integration**: Integration with course management and student profiles to facilitate effective teaching and monitoring of student progress.

### News and Events

- **Implementation**: News articles and upcoming events are displayed prominently on the platform, with options for users to filter by category, date, or relevance.
- **Features**: Users can view detailed event descriptions, RSVP to events, and receive notifications for upcoming activities.
