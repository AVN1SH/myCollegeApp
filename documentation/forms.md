## Forms and Validation

### Form Handling

- **Form Libraries**: The project uses standard HTML forms along with React libraries such as Formik for efficient form handling and validation.
  
- **Form Components**: Custom form components are implemented using React, ensuring reusability and consistency across the application. These components encapsulate form fields, validation logic, and submission handlers.
  
- **Form State Management**: Local component state (`useState`) manages form data and user input changes, ensuring responsive updates to form fields as users interact with the UI.
  
- **Controlled Components**: React's controlled component pattern is employed to tie form inputs directly to component state, facilitating real-time validation and synchronization between UI and data.

### Validation

- **Zod Schemas**: Zod schemas are utilized for robust data validation, ensuring that form inputs meet specified criteria such as minimum length, valid email format, and required fields.
  
- **Custom Validators**: Custom validation functions are implemented to enforce complex validation rules, such as password strength requirements and unique field constraints.
  
- **Error Handling**: Validation errors are managed and displayed to users through error messages near relevant form fields, guiding them to correct input errors and improve data integrity.

### File Uploads

- **File Input Components**: React components handle file uploads using `<input type="file">`, allowing users to upload files such as images, documents, and certificates required for various application processes.
  
- **Validation**: Zod schemas validate uploaded files, ensuring that required files are attached and that file types and sizes meet specified criteria.
  
- **File Handling**: Upon form submission, files are processed server-side, stored securely in cloud storage or on the server, and associated with relevant user or application records for future reference.
