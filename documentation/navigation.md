## Navigation

### Routing

- **React Router**: Implements React Router for declarative routing in the application, enabling navigation between different views and components based on URL changes.
  
- **Route Configuration**: Defines routes using `<Route>` components, specifying paths and corresponding components to render when navigating to specific URLs.
  
- **Nested Routes**: Supports nested routing structures to manage hierarchical views, such as dashboard sections, user profiles, and detailed course pages.

### Dynamic Navigation

- **Linking Components**: Uses `<Link>` from React Router to create clickable links, ensuring efficient navigation between pages without full page reloads.
  
- **Programmatic Navigation**: Utilizes `useHistory` hook for programmatic navigation, enabling redirection based on user actions or application state changes.
  
- **Conditional Navigation**: Implements conditional rendering of navigation elements based on user roles or authentication status, ensuring appropriate access control and user experience.
