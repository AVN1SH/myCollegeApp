## Technology Used

The My College web application utilizes a modern technology stack to deliver a robust and responsive user experience. The key technologies and frameworks employed include:

- **Frontend:**
  - **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, providing a component-based architecture for seamless UI development.
  - **Redux Toolkit**: A predictable state container for managing application state, used with React for efficient data flow and state management.
  - **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that enhances code quality and developer productivity through static type-checking.
  - **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that enables rapid UI development with pre-defined classes for styling components.

- **Backend Integration:**
  - **Django REST Framework**: A powerful and flexible toolkit for building Web APIs in Python, used to develop robust backend services for data retrieval and manipulation.
  - **RESTful API**: Utilized for communication between the frontend application and the Django backend server to fetch and update data asynchronously.

- **Build Tools and Package Managers:**
  - **Vite**: A fast build tool that provides a modern development experience with features like hot module replacement and optimized builds.
  - **Yarn**: A package manager used for dependency management, ensuring efficient package installation and version control.

- **Linting and Formatting:**
  - **ESLint**: A pluggable linting utility for JavaScript and TypeScript, ensuring code consistency and identifying potential errors.
  - **Prettier**: A code formatter used alongside ESLint to enforce code style and formatting conventions across the codebase.

- **Version Control and Collaboration:**
  - **Git**: A distributed version control system used for managing source code changes and facilitating collaborative development.
  - **GitHub**: A platform hosting Git repositories, used for version control, issue tracking, and collaborative development workflows.

- **Deployment and Hosting:**
  - **Vercel**: A cloud platform for static sites and serverless functions, used for deploying and hosting the My College frontend application.
  - **PythonAnywhere**: A cloud-based Python web hosting service, used for deploying and hosting the Django backend application.

This technology stack ensures that the My College application is built on modern, efficient tools and frameworks, enabling scalable development, robust performance, and a seamless user experience.
