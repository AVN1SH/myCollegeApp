## Deployment

### Build Process

- **Production Build**: Execute the production build process using Vite to compile TypeScript, bundle assets, and optimize the application for deployment.

- **Environment Variables**: Manage environment-specific configuration by utilizing `.env` files, ensuring secure storage and injection of variables like API endpoints and credentials during the build.

### Deployment Steps

1. **Commit Changes**: Commit all changes and ensure the repository is up-to-date with the latest codebase.

2. **Deployment Platform**: Choose Vercel as the deployment platform for its integration with Git repositories and automated deployment workflows.

3. **Configure Deployment Settings**: Set up deployment configurations in Vercel, including environment variables, build commands, and deployment hooks.

4. **Trigger Deployment**: Initiate deployment on Vercel by connecting the project repository and specifying the branch for deployment (e.g., main, master).

5. **Build and Deploy**: Vercel triggers a build process upon new commits, compiling the application, running tests if configured, and deploying the built artifacts to production.

6. **Post-Deployment Checks**: Perform post-deployment checks to verify the application's functionality, ensure environment variables are correctly injected, and monitor for any deployment-related issues.

7. **Monitoring and Alerts**: Set up monitoring and alerts for deployment status and application performance metrics using Vercel's dashboard or external monitoring tools.

8. **Testing and Rollback**: Conduct testing on the deployed application to confirm stability and functionality. Implement rollback procedures if issues arise, reverting to a previous deployment version if necessary.

9. **Documentation Update**: Update deployment documentation, including any changes to deployment procedures, environment configurations, or post-deployment tasks.

10. **Maintenance**: Schedule regular maintenance tasks such as updates, patches, and performance optimizations to keep the deployed application running smoothly.
